Given the BST 

			12
		  /    \
		 6      20
 		/ \    /
	   1   9  15

Give preorder, inorder and post order traversal of its nodes

Pre: 12, 6, 1, 9, 20, 15  (print, explore left, explore right)
In: 1, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20   (explore left, print, explore right)
Post: 1, 9, 6, 15, 20, 12 (explore left, explore right, print)


Where would 11 be inserted into the tree?

			12
		 /      \
		6       20
 	   / \      /
	  1   9    15
	       \
	       11


What would the tree look like if we were to remove 12?

   			9              15
		   / \            /  \
		  6   20   or    6    20

Given the following pre order traversal of a tree:
[40, 30, 35, 20, 80, 100]

is this a valid bst?

	40	
   /
  30
   \
    35

no this is not a valid bst because 20 would be in right sub tree of 30

Given the following pre order traversal of a tree:
[20, 11, 13, 65, 90]

is this a valid bst?
	
yes this is a valid bst


Given the following hashtable:

[null,0,81,null,9,null,null,null,null]

assuming our hashfunction = number being inserted % tablesize,

with open addressing and 2^i probing, where would the number 27 go?

i = 0 -> 2^0 = 1
i = 0+1 -> 2^1 = 2
i = 1+1 -> 2^2 = 4
i = 2+1 -> 2^3 = 8

we can insert 27 into the index 8

resulting table;
[null,0,81,null,9,null,null,null,27]


with chaining, where would 45 go?

45 would go into index 0






Given the following tree:
	  
	  	  2
	 	   \
			5 
		   / \ 
		  3   7


with these as your default bst rotation functions

public Node<E> rotateRight() {
		//this refers to mode who rotate is being called from
	    Node<E> temp = this.left;
	    this.left = temp.right;
	    temp.right = this;
	    return temp;	    
	}

	public Node<E> rotateLeft() {
		//this refers to mode who rotate is being called from
	    Node<E> temp = this.right;
	    this.right = temp.left;
	    temp.left = this;
	    return temp;	    
	}


what would a right rotate of node 5 look like?
